# JURL - URL Shortener
Small and easy to use URL shortener.
<br><br>

Webpage for making redirect URLs is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with jQuery for ajax).
For redirect website I used PHP which requests from server full URL based on short URL code. Than it redirects user to that link.

Back-end is made in Python with Flask as web server.

Links are stored in SQLite file with SqliteDict library as key-value pairs of main url and redirect url code.
